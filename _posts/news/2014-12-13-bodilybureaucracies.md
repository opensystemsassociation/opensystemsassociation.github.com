Bodily Bureaucracies is a collectively led workshop exploring what happens to our bodies as they give out data, are affected by data, act through data and are stored as data in different systems.

First we will experiment with how data moves our bodies and our bodies move data. Then, using materials brought by participants, we'll find ways to open up how types of power are exercised through data.

Bring along your bureaucratic monster. It might be:

-a housing benefits form

-a calorie counting spreadsheet

-your internet history

-your oyster record

-a nursery accident report

-or something else! 

The systems we engage with can relate to sensitive issues, so please only bring material that you are happy to share in a group setting.

**Time and place**
Saturday 13th December 12.00-2.00pm
The Common House, 5E Punderson's Gardens, London E2 9QG.
