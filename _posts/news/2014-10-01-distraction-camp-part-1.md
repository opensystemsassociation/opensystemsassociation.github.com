The Open Systems Association is hosting an informal discussion event on distraction, health and computational culture. Itâ€™s the start of a project on ideas and practices around attention, bodies and power. All are welcome. Come along, listen and share your ideas!

**How it will work:**
Everyone has a chance to give a short five minute talk on the topic from their own perspective. All forms of knowledge, expertise and experience are welcome.
We keep on discussing, or go have some drinks!

**Possible topics** (final topics to be decided on the night): What is distraction? How does digital media affect to our bodies? Can a software algorithm be distracted? How do digital distractions relate to biopolitics? The commons? Software design? Ecology? How do different technologies act on, with, against or through our attention?

**Where and When:**
Wednesday 8th October 7-9pm.
Look Mum No Hands,
49 Old Street,
London.
EC1V 9HX
