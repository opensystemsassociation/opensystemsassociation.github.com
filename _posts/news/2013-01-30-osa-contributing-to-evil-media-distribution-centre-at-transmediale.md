For this years [Transmediale](http://www.transmediale.de/) festival for media art and digital culture OSA have contributed to the [Evil Media Distribution Centre](http://www.transmediale.de/content/evil-media-distribution-centre). An artistic response, in the form of installation project, to the recently published book [Evil Media by Matt Fuller](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/evil-media-0). Evil Media Distribution Centre is the work of Graham Harwood and Matsuko Yokokoji
([YoHa](http://yoha.co.uk/)).
OSA members will also be present at Transmediale attending workshops, conferences and exhibitions throughout...and generally enjoying what Berlin has to offer.
