On the evening of the summer solstice, members of the Open System Association will move the familiar framework of the kitchen into the experimental project space of [Harts Lane Studios](http://hartslanestudios.org/2013/06/13/harts-lane-studios-hosts-everything-but-the-kitchen-june-21-23/): an 11 hour material enquiry into how time is produced through relations between physical processes and is restructured through cultural and political techniques.

Engineered, commodified and consumed, kitchen time becomes labour time sold as leisure. By probing the powers underlying domestic drudgery, sociable seasons and cruel technologies, could we make it something different?

Opening Event: Friday 21 June 2013 6-9PM
Open: Saturday 22 and Sunday 23 June 2013 2-6PM
