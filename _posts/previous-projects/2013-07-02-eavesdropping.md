EAVESDROPPING re-proposes a mode of perception of people affected by Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In the installation, the home becomes a fragmented/blurred space where objects trigger personal testimonies of people with OCD. Eavesdropping is a result of interrogations into the structures of computation and an enriching collaboration with people affected by OCD.
