Members of the Open Systems Association have contributed texts to the [Evil Media Distribution Centre](http://www.transmediale.de/content/evil-media-distribution-centre), now on display at the 2013 [Transmediale festival](http://www.transmediale.de/) in Berlin. The installation is an artistic response by [YoHa](http://yoha.co.uk/) to the recently published book Evil Media (2012) by Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey, which focusses on the pervasive presence of so-called “gray media” - an expanded notion of media or forms of mediation that provides a deeper, more complex understanding of their
effects on how we act, perceive and think in our daily lives. The artists have invited 66 contributors to choose and write a short text about a gray media object (ranging from tampons to software compilers), and these texts and objects are then presented in the setting of a curiosity cabinet designed as a distribution center.
