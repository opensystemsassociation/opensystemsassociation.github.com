                On the evening of the summer solstice, members of the Open System Association (OSA) will move the familiar framework of the kitchen out from the home or restaurant, and into the experimental project space of Harts Lane Studios. Over 11 hours of material enquiry will explore how time is produced through the relations between physical processes and is restructured through cultural and political techniques.  Engineered, commodified and consumed, kitchen time becomes labour time sold as leisure, but could we make it something different? Could we carry with it the wetness, warmth and sheer burning alkalinity of the substances, practices and forces we find within its walls and streaming through its windows?<br><br>



                <i>Everything but the Kitchen</i> tinkers with unseen energies, unrecognised practices and unpaid forms of physical, emotional and material labour which fall outside normative notions of time. It brings together the on-going work of eight artists from OSA within a common frame.  With the help of friends and visitors, they will chart the experiences of time and labour in relation to each practice and project. This will serve as a map of the knowledge created and uncovered during 11 hours of embodied speculation, as members of OSA prod and poke at the powers underlying domestic drudgery, sociable seasons and cruel technologies.<br><br>
